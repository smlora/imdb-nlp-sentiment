Tokenizing the first few generated reviews allowed us to verify that the reviews were being correctly processed into integer sequences. Checking the GPT-2 model’s vocabulary size (88,584 words) provided context for why some generated tokens may not align with the initial 20,000-word limit used in the classifier model — prompting an adjustment to improve alignment between the two models."

        "While the final results demonstrate a successful alignment between the generated reviews and positive sentiment, reaching that point required thoughtful iteration. Initially, the classifier reported low probabilities (averaging around 25–30%) for the generated reviews, indicating a disconnect between the language model and the sentiment classifier. This prompted us to explore several adjustments — including filtering the GPT-2 vocabulary, increasing the classifier’s vocabulary size to 40,000, and experimenting with sampling strategies. These changes offered incremental improvements, but it wasn’t until we trained the GPT-2 model for three full epochs that the shift in sentiment became clearly measurable. Despite long training times (approximately 10 minutes per epoch on a T4 GPU), this effort proved essential. The process reinforced the importance of both model alignment and persistence in applied deep learning tasks."

        "## Project Summary\n",
        "In this project, we built a sentiment classifier using a Bidirectional LSTM model trained on the IMDB movie review dataset. After preprocessing and tokenizing the data, we trained the model to achieve over 85% validation accuracy, and evaluated it using a classification report and ROC AUC score, both of which confirmed strong performance. We then fine-tuned a GPT-2 language model on a filtered subset of positive reviews to generate synthetic text with an optimistic tone. Generated reviews were evaluated using the trained classifier, revealing that the majority were correctly classified as positive, confirming the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process."

        "This project demonstrated how a generative language model can be conditioned through fine-tuning to produce sentiment-aligned text, and how a separately trained classifier can be used to evaluate the success of this alignment. By integrating preprocessing, deep learning classification, and language generation, we created a pipeline that not only generates human-readable reviews, but also maintains a targeted emotional tone."
